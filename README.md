# proctored

Online proctoring platform prototype using Webrtc .
Backend - NodeJS + ExpressJS
WebServices - WebRTC , Websockets
Database - Firebase Firestore
Frontend - EJS Templating , Bootstrap , SweetAlertJS, JQuery

This was an experimental project to Learn to use WebRTC for different uses like for sharing realtime data like live feed from camera, screen & text.

For this project, No Webrtc libraries were used , because I really wanted to learn the complete details of setting up webRTC which includes setting up the signalling server & client-side setup (both proctor & candidate) .
